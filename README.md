- PowerShell (comes pre-installed with Windows)

## üì• Installation
1. Download the `split_large_files.bat` script
2. Place it in any directory containing files you want to split Or simply copy the script contents and save as a .bat file

## üöÄ Usage
1. Place the script in the folder containing your large file(s)
2. Double-click to run the script
3. Select the file you want to split from the displayed list
4. Confirm the operation
5. Wait for the process to complete

### Example Output
```
Files larger than 2GB:
---------------------
1) largefile.zst (13183150086 bytes)

Enter the number of the file you want to split (1-1) or Q to quit:
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Default settings (can be modified in the script):
```batch
set "CHUNK_SIZE=2000M"
set "COMPRESSION=0"
set "METHOD=gnu"
set "CPU_THREADS=4"
```

## üìù Logging
The script creates a detailed log file (`file_splitter.log`) in the same directory, containing:
- Timestamp for all operations
- File detection results
- User selections
- 7-Zip command outputs
- Error messages (if any)

Example log entry:
```
=== Script started at 20240116_143022 ===
Working directory: C:\YourDirectory
Starting file analysis...
Found large file: example.zst (13183150086 bytes)
```

## üîÑ File Reassembly
To recreate the original file:

1. Open 7-Zip
2. Navigate to the folder containing split files
3. Select the first file (*.tar.001)
4. Click Extract

Or use 7-Zip command line:
```cmd
"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x "yourfile.tar.001"
```

## ‚ùó Common Issues
1. **Script closes immediately**
   - Run from command prompt to see error messages
   - Check if 7-Zip is installed in the default location

2. **'PowerShell' is not recognized**
   - Ensure PowerShell is installed and in system PATH

3. **Access Denied Errors**
   - Run as administrator
   - Check file permissions
